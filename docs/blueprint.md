## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: A muted teal (#45A0A0) for a blend of sophistication and tranquility. This avoids overused bright colors while maintaining a modern aesthetic.
- Background color: A very light grey (#F0F0F0), nearly white, providing a clean and professional backdrop that ensures readability and reduces visual fatigue.
- Accent color: A soft orange (#D4A373) is used to highlight calls to action and important interactive elements, providing warmth and contrast against the teal and light grey.
- Body font: 'PT Sans' for body text; a humanist sans-serif providing a blend of modern look and readability; headline font: 'Space Grotesk', a sans-serif for headings, short and impactful titles and CTAs.
- Use 'lucide-react' icons consistently throughout the application for a clean and modern look. Ensure icons are intuitive and match the context in which they are used.
- Implement a responsive, mobile-first design using Tailwind CSS. Ensure all pages are adaptable to different screen sizes, providing a seamless experience on both desktop and mobile devices.
- Incorporate subtle animations, such as smooth scrolling and transitions on interactive elements, to enhance user experience. Avoid excessive animations to maintain a professional look.
